# CNN-Based-Steering-Angle-Estimation
 In this university project, we designed and trained a CNN model capable of estimating the steering angle from an input image of a steering wheel. The project utilized an ESP32-CAM Dev board for image capture and an MPU6050 IMU sensor for measuring corresponding steering angles.
